While browsing a variety of websites, I kept finding that the same financial metric can greatly vary per source and so do the financial statements reported while little information is given how the metric was calculated.

For example, Microsoft's Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio on the 6th of May, 2023 is reported to be 28.93 (Stockopedia), 32.05 (Morningstar), 32.66 (Macrotrends), 33.09 (Finance Charts), 33.66 (Y Charts), 33.67 (Wall Street Journal), 33.80 (Yahoo Finance) and 34.4 (Companies Market Cap). All of these calculations are correct, however the method applied varies leading to different results. Therefore, collecting data from multiple sources can lead to wrong interpretation of the results given that one source could be applying a different calculation method than another. And that is, if it is even freely available. Often the calculation is hidden behind a paid subscription.

**This is why I designed the FinanceToolkit**, this is an open-source toolkit in which all relevant financial ratios ([180+](#available-metrics)), indicators and performance measurements are written down in the most simplistic way allowing for complete transparency of the calculation method ([proof](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceToolkit/blob/main/financetoolkit/ratios/valuation_model.py)). This allows you to not have to rely on metrics from other providers and, given a financial statement, allow for efficient manual calculations. This leads to one uniform method of calculation being applied that is available and understood by everyone.

The Finance Toolkit not only supports Equities. Even for Options, Currencies, Cryptocurrencies, ETFs, Mutual Funds, Indices, Money Markets, Commodities, Key Economic Indicators and more, the Finance Toolkit can be used to obtain historical data as well as important performance and risk measurements such as the Sharpe Ratio and Value at Risk.

The Finance Toolkit is complimented very well with the [Finance Database ðŸŒŽ](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase), a database that features 300.000+ symbols containing Equities, ETFs, Funds, Indices, Currencies, Cryptocurrencies and Money Markets. By utilising both, it is possible to do a fully-fledged competitive analysis with the tickers found from the FinanceDatabase inputted into the FinanceToolkit.

</p>

A basic example of how to use the Finance Toolkit is shown below.


````python
from financetoolkit import Toolkit

companies = Toolkit(["AAPL", "MSFT"], api_key=API_KEY, start_date="2017-12-31")

# a Historical example
historical_data = companies.get_historical_data()

# a Financial Statement example
income_statement = companies.get_income_statement()

# a Ratios example
profitability_ratios = companies.ratios.collect_profitability_ratios()

# a Models example
extended_dupont_analysis = companies.models.get_extended_dupont_analysis()

# an Options example
all_greeks = companies.options.collect_all_greeks(expiration_time_range=180)

# a Performance example
factor_asset_correlations = companies.performance.get_factor_asset_correlations(
    period="quarterly"
)

# a Risk example
value_at_risk = companies.risk.get_value_at_risk(period="weekly")

# a Technical example
ichimoku_cloud = companies.technicals.get_ichimoku_cloud()

# a Fixed Income example
corporate_bond_yields = companies.fixed_income.get_ice_bofa_effective_yield()

# an Economics example
unemployment_rates = companies.economics.get_unemployment_rate()
````

Generally, the functions return a DataFrame with a multi-index in which all tickers, in this case Apple and Microsoft, are presented. To keep things manageable for this README, I select just Apple but in essence the list of tickers can be endless as I've seen DataFrames with thousands of tickers. The filtering is done through `.loc['AAPL']` and `.xs('AAPL', level=1, axis=1)` based on whether it's fundamental data or historical data respectively.

### Obtaining Historical Data

Obtain historical data on a daily, weekly, monthly or yearly basis. This includes OHLC, volumes, dividends, returns, cumulative returns and volatility calculations for each corresponding period. For example, the a portion of the historical data for Apple is shown below.

| date       |    Open |    High |     Low |   Close |   Adj Close |      Volume |   Dividends |   Return |   Volatility |   Excess Return |   Excess Volatility |   Cumulative Return |
|:-----------|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|------------:|------------:|------------:|---------:|-------------:|----------------:|--------------------:|--------------------:|

### Obtaining Financial Ratios

Get Profitability Ratios based on the inputted balance sheet, income and cash flow statements. This can be any of the 50+ ratios within the `ratios` module. The `get_` functions show a single ratio whereas the `collect_` functions show an aggregation of multiple ratios. For example, see some of the profitability ratios of Microsoft below.

|                                 |    2017 |    2018 |    2019 |    2020 |    2021 |    2022 |    2023 |
|:--------------------------------|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|

### Obtaining Financial Models

Get an Extended DuPont Analysis based on the inputted balance sheet, income and cash flow statements. This can also be an Enterprise Value Breakdown, Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), Altman Z-Score and many more models. For example, this shows the Extended DuPont Analysis for Apple:

|                         |     2017 |   2018 |   2019 |   2020 |   2021 |   2022 |   2023 |
|:------------------------|---------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|
| Interest Burden Ratio   |   0.9572 | 0.9725 | 0.9725 | 0.988  | 0.9976 | 1.0028 | 1.005  |
| Tax Burden Ratio        |   0.7882 | 0.8397 | 0.8643 | 0.8661 | 0.869  | 0.8356 | 0.8486 |
| Operating Profit Margin |   0.2796 | 0.2745 | 0.2527 | 0.2444 | 0.2985 | 0.302  | 0.2967 |

| Return on Equity        | nan      | 0.4936 | 0.5592 | 0.7369 | 1.4744 | 1.7546 | 1.7195 |

And below each component of the Extended Dupont Analysis is plotted including the resulting Return on Equity (ROE).

![Models](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceToolkit/assets/46355364/f5e1cab3-d1bd-455d-a4ba-92e1348163be)

### Obtaining Options and Greeks

Get the Black Scholes Model for both call and put options including the relevant Greeks, in this case Delta, Gamma, Theta and Vega. This can be any of the First, Second or Third Order Greeks as found in the the `options` module. The `get_` functions show a single Greek whereas the `collect_` functions show an aggregation of Greeks. For example, see the delta of the Call options for Apple for multiple expiration times and strike prices below (Stock Price: 185.92, Volatility: 31.59%, Dividend Yield: 0.49% and Risk Free Rate: 3.95%):

|     |   1 Month |   2 Months |   3 Months |   4 Months |   5 Months |   6 Months |
|----:|----------:|-----------:|-----------:|-----------:|-----------:|-----------:|
| 175 |    0.7686 |     0.7178 |     0.6967 |     0.6857 |     0.6794 |     0.6759 |
| 180 |    0.6659 |     0.64   |     0.6318 |     0.629  |     0.6285 |     0.6291 |
| 185 |    0.5522 |     0.5583 |     0.5648 |     0.571  |     0.5767 |     0.5816 |
| 190 |    0.4371 |     0.4762 |     0.4977 |     0.513  |     0.5249 |     0.5342 |
| 195 |    0.3298 |     0.3971 |     0.4324 |     0.4562 |     0.474  |     0.4875 |

![Greeks](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceToolkit/assets/46355364/3aebe116-c4ac-4845-9801-54d2b4bde0f5)

### Obtaining Performance Metrics

Get the correlations with the factors as defined by Fama-and-French. These include market, size, value, operating profitability and investment. The beauty of all functionality here is that it can be based on any period as the function accepts the period `intraday`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `quarterly` and `yearly`. For example, this shows the quarterly correlations for Apple:

|        |   Mkt-RF |     SMB |     HML |     RMW |     CMA |
|:-------|---------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|
| 2022Q2 |   0.9177 | -0.1248 | -0.5077 | -0.3202 | -0.2624 |
| 2022Q3 |   0.8092 |  0.1528 | -0.5046 | -0.1997 | -0.5231 |
| 2022Q4 |   0.8998 |  0.2309 | -0.5968 | -0.1868 | -0.5946 |
| 2023Q1 |   0.7737 |  0.1606 | -0.3775 | -0.228  | -0.5707 |

### Obtaining Risk Metrics

Get the Value at Risk for each week. Here, the days within each week are considered for the Value at Risk. This makes it so that you can understand within each period what is the expected Value at Risk (VaR) which can again be any period but also based on distributions such as Historical, Gaussian, Student-t, Cornish-Fisher.

|                       |    AAPL |    MSFT |   Benchmark |

### Explore your own Portfolio

Through a custom XLSX, XLS or CSV file you are able to load in your own portfolio directly into the Finance Toolkit. This allows you to view your positions and performance (over time) versus a benchmark and other positions as well as your PnL development over time. Furthermore, the portfolio can be directly loaded in the core functionality of the Finance Toolkit as well making it possible to calculate all metrics and ratios for your portfolio (which is a time-weighted sum of all positions). The portfolio module is a standalone module and can be used as such by using `from financetoolkit import Portfolio`.

# Questions & Answers

This section includes frequently asked questions and is meant to clear up confusion about certain results and/or deviations from other sources. If you have any questions that are not answered here, feel free to reach out to me via the contact details below.

> **How do you deal with companies that have different fiscal years?**

For any financial statement, I make sure to line it up with the corresponding *calendar* period. For example, Apple's Q4 2023 relates to July to September of 2023. This corresponds to the calendar period Q3 which is why I normalize Apple's numbers to Q3 2023 instead. This is done to allow for comparison between companies that have different fiscal years.

> **Why do the numbers in the financial statements sometimes deviate from the data from FinancialModelingPrep?**

When looking at a company such as Hyundai Motor Company (ticker: 005380.KS), you will notice that the financial statements are reported in KRW (South Korean won). As this specific ticker is listed on the Korean Exchange, the historical market data will also be reported in KRW. However, if you use the ticker HYMTF, which is listed on the American OTC market, the historical market data will be reported in USD. To deal with this discrepancy, the end of year or end of quarter exchange rate is retrieved which is used to convert the financial statements to USD. This is done to prevent ratio calculations such as the Free Cash Flow Yield (which is based on the market capitalization) or Price Earnings Ratio (which is based on the stock price) from being incorrect. This can be disabled by setting `convert_currency=False` in the Toolkit initialization. It is recommended to always use the ticker that is listed on the exchange where the company is based.

> **How can I get TTM (Trailing Twelve Months) and Growth metrics?**

Most functions will have the option to define the `trailing` parameter. This lets you define the number of periods that you want to use to calculate the trailing metrics. For example, if you want to calculate the trailing 12-month (TTM) Price-to-Earnings Ratio, you can set `trailing=4` when you have set `quarterly=True` in the Toolkit initialization. The same goes for growth metrics which can be calculated by setting `growth=True`. This will calculate the growth for each period based on the previous period. This also includes a `lag` parameter in which you can define lagged growth. Furthermore, you can also combine the trailing and growth parameters to get trailing growth. For example, set `trailing=4` and `growth=True`  for the Price-to-Earnings Ratio which will then calculate the TTM growth.

> **How can I save the data periodically so that I don't have to retrieve it every single time again?**

The Toolkit has the option to work with cached data through `use_cached_data=True` when initializing the Toolkit class. If you then use any of the functionalities of the Toolkit itself (e.g. `get_balance_sheet_statement`) it will store the data in a pickle file. When initializing the Toolkit class again with `use_cached_data=True`, it will load the data from the pickle file including all other previously set parameters (e.g. start_date and quarterly). You are also able to select a specific location to store the cached data by providing a string to the `use_cached_data` parameter. This will store the data in the provided location (with the assumption the folder exists).

> **What is the "Benchmark" that is automatically obtained when acquiring historical data?**

This is related to the `benchmark_ticker` parameter which is set to "SPY" (S&P 500) by default. This is important when calculating performance metrics such as the Sharpe Ratio or Treynor Ratio that require a market return. This can be disabled by setting `benchmark_ticker=None` in the Toolkit initialization.

> **Data collection seems to be slow, what could be the issue?**

Generally, it should take less than 15 seconds to retrieve the historical data of 100 tickers. If it takes much longer, this could be due to reaching the API limit (the Starter plan has 250 requests per minute), due to a slow internet connection or due to unoptimized code. As the Finance Toolkit makes use of threading, initializing the Toolkit with a single ticker will result in a slow process. This is because the Toolkit will have to wait for the previous request to finish before it can start the next one. Therefore, it is recommended to initialize the Toolkit with all tickers you want to analyze. If it is taking 10+ minutes consider having a look at [this issue](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceToolkit/issues/99#issuecomment-1889726000) that managed to resolve the problem.

> **Are you part of FinancialModelingPrep?**

*No, I am not*. I've merely picked them as the primary data provider given that they have a generous free tier and fair pricing compared to other providers. Therefore, any questions related to the data should go through [their contact form](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/contact). When it comes to any type of ratios, performance metrics, risk metrics, technical indicators or economic indicators, feel free to reach out to me as this is my own work.

The goal of the Finance Toolkit is to make any type of financial calculation as transparent and efficient as possible. I want to make these type of calculations as accessible to anyone as possible and seeing how many websites exists that do the same thing (but instead you have to pay) gave me plenty of reasons to work on this.
