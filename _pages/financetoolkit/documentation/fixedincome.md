## get_present_value
Calculates the bond prices for different coupon rates and years to maturity. The bond price is the present value of the bond's future cash flows, which includes the coupon payments and the par value of the bond at maturity. The bond price is calculated using the following formula:


- Bond Price = (C / r) * (1 - (1 + r)^
-n) + F / (1 + r)^n

where:


- C = Coupon payment per period 
- r = Yield to maturity per period 
- n = Number of periods 
- F = Face value of the bond

The bond price is used to determine the fair value of the bond and to compare the bond's price to its market price to determine if the bond is overvalued or undervalued.

**Args:**
 - <u>par_value (float):</u> The par value (face value) of the bond.
 - <u>coupon_rate (float, optional):</u> The coupon rate of the bond. If not provided, a range of coupon rates will be used.
 - <u>years_to_maturity (float, optional):</u> The years to maturity of the bond in years. If not provided, a range of years to maturity will be used.
 - <u>yield_to_maturity (float, optional):</u> The yield to maturity of the bond. If not provided, a default value of 0.05 will be used.
 - <u>frequency (int, optional):</u> The frequency of coupon payments per year. Defaults to 1.
 - <u>show_input_info (bool, optional):</u> Whether to display input information. Defaults to True.

 **Returns:**
 pandas.DataFrame: A DataFrame containing the bond prices for different coupon rates and years to maturity.
## get_duration
Calculates the bond duration for different coupon rates and years to maturity. It has the option to calculate the following type of bond durations:


- Macaulay's Duration: The weighted average time to receive the bond's cash flows. 
- Modified Duration: The Macaulay's duration divided by 1 plus the yield to maturity. 
- Effective Duration: The percentage change in the bond price for a 1% change in the yield to maturity. 
- Dollar Duration: The modified duration multiplied by the bond price.

These duration measures can be used to estimate the sensitivity of a bond's price to changes in interest rates as well as to compare the risk of different bonds. The modified duration is particularly useful for estimating the percentage change in the bond price for a 1% change in the yield to maturity. This is also known as the bond's price value of a basis point (PVBP), or the bond's dollar duration (DD) or dollar value of a .01% change (DV01).

**Args:**
 - <u>duration_type (str, optional):</u> The type of duration to calculate. Defaults to 'modified' but can also
 be 'macaulay', 'effective' or 'dollar'.
 - <u>par_value (float, optional):</u> The par value (face value) of the bond. Defaults to None.
 - <u>coupon_rate (float, optional):</u> The coupon rate of the bond. If not provided, a range of coupon
 rates will be used. Defaults to None.
 - <u>years_to_maturity (float, optional):</u> The years to maturity of the bond in years. If not provided, a range of years
 to maturity will be used. Defaults to None.
 - <u>yield_to_maturity (float, optional):</u> The yield to maturity of the bond. If not provided, a default
 value of 0.05 will be used. Defaults to None.
 - <u>frequency (int, optional):</u> The frequency of coupon payments per year. Defaults to 1.
 - <u>show_input_info (bool, optional):</u> Whether to display input information. Defaults to True.

 **Returns:**
 pandas.DataFrame: A DataFrame containing the bond duration for different coupon rates and years to maturity.
## get_yield_to_maturity
Calculates the yield to maturity for a bond. The yield to maturity is the internal rate of return of the bond, which is the discount rate that equates the present value of the bond's cash flows to its market price. The yield to maturity is used to estimate the bond's return and to compare the bond's return to other investments.

The yield to maturity is calculated using the following formula:


- Bond Price = (C / r) * (1 - (1 + r)^
-n) + F / (1 + r)^n

where:


- C = Coupon payment per period 
- r = Yield to maturity per period 
- n = Number of periods 
- F = Face value of the bond

The goal is to find the yield to maturity that satisfies the equation above. This is done using the Newton
-Raphson method which is an iterative method that converges to the root of a function.

**Args:**
 - <u>par_value (float):</u> The par value (face value) of the bond. This is the original price when it was issued by the issuer.
 - <u>coupon_rate (float, optional):</u> The coupon rate of the bond. Defaults to None.
 - <u>years_to_maturity (float, optional):</u> The years to maturity of the bond in years. Defaults to None.
 - <u>bond_price (float, optional):</u> The price of the bond. Defaults to None.
 - <u>frequency (int, optional):</u> The number of coupon payments per year. Defaults to 1.
 - <u>guess (float, optional):</u> The initial guess for the yield to maturity. Defaults to 0.05.
 - <u>tolerance (float, optional):</u> The tolerance level for convergence. Defaults to 0.0001.
 - <u>max_iterations (int, optional):</u> The maximum number of iterations for convergence. Defaults to 100.
 - <u>show_input_info (bool, optional):</u> Whether to display input information. Defaults to True.

 **Returns:**
 pandas.DataFrame: A DataFrame containing the yield to maturity for different bond prices and years to maturity.
## get_derivative_price
Calculates the derivative price for a fixed income instrument.

It is possible to use two different models to calculate the derivative price:


- Black Model: A mathematical model used for pricing financial derivatives, its primary applications are for pricing options on future contracts, bond options, interest rate cap and floors, and swaptions. For more information, see: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_model){:target="_blank"} 
- Bachelier Model: A deviation of the Black Model that is used for pricing future contracts. It is a simple model that assumes the price of the underlying asset follows a normal distribution with constant volatility. This is in contrast to the Black Model which assumes the price of the underlying asset follows a log
-normal distribution. For more information, see: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelier_model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelier_model){:target="_blank"}

It is possible to alter all parameters within the models, e.g. strike rate, volatility, years to maturity, risk
-free rate, notional amount, and whether the holder is the receiver or payer of the derivative. Next to that, you can provide lists of values for the fixed rate, strike rate, volatility, and years to maturity to calculate the derivative price for multiple scenarios outside of the standard sample.

**Args:**
 - <u>model (str, optional):</u> The type of model to use for calculating the derivative price. Defaults to "black".
 - <u>forward_rate (float, optional):</u> The forward rate as derived from the swap curve. Defaults to None.
 - <u>strike_rate (float | list, optional):</u> The strike rate for the derivative. Defaults to None which means it calculates the
 derivative price a range of strike prices. Can also be a list of strike rates (e.g. [0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05]).
 - <u>volatility (float, optional):</u> The volatility of the underlying asset. Defaults to None.
 - <u>years_to_maturity (float | list, optional):</u> The years to maturity of the derivative in years. Defaults to None which means it plots
 the derivative price for the next 10 years. Can also be a list of years to maturity (e.g. [1, 2.3, 2.5, 3])
 - <u>risk_free_rate (float, optional):</u> The risk-free interest rate. Defaults to None which means it is equal to the fixed rate.
 - <u>notional (float, optional):</u> The notional amount of the derivative. Defaults to 10_000_000.
 - <u>is_receiver (bool, optional):</u> True if the holder is the receiver of the derivative, False if the holder is the payer. Defaults to True.
 - <u>include_payoff (bool, optional):</u> True to include the payoff in the output, False otherwise. Defaults to False.
 - <u>show_input_info (bool, optional):</u> True to display input information, False otherwise. Defaults to True.

 **Returns:**
 pandas.DataFrame: The Black derivative prices rounded to the specified decimal places.
 pandas.- <u>DataFrame (optional):</u> The Black derivative payoffs rounded to the specified decimal places if include_payoff is True.

 For example:
{% include code_header.html %}
{% highlight python %}
from financetoolkit import FixedIncome

fixedincome = FixedIncome()

# You can also provide lists of values for the strike rate and years to maturity
# to define your own strike rates and years to maturity to display in the DataFrame
fixedincome.get_derivative_price(model_type='black', forward_rate=0.0325)
{% endhighlight %}

## get_government_bond_yield
Long
-term interest rates refer to government bonds maturing in ten years. Rates are mainly determined by the price charged by the lender, the risk from the borrower and the fall in the capital value. Long
-term interest rates are generally averages of daily rates, measured as a percentage. These interest rates are implied by the prices at which the government bonds are traded on financial markets, not the interest rates at which the loans were issued.

In all cases, they refer to bonds whose capital repayment is guaranteed by governments. Long
-term interest rates are one of the determinants of business investment. Low long term interest rates encourage investment in new equipment and high interest rates discourage it. Investment is, in turn, a major source of economic growth

See definition: [https://data.oecd.org/interest/long
-term
-interest
-rates.htm](https://data.oecd.org/interest/long
-term

-rates.htm){:target="_blank"}

Short
-term interest rates are the rates at which short
-term borrowings are effected between financial institutions or the rate at which short
-term government paper is issued or traded in the market. Short
-term interest rates are generally averages of daily rates, measured as a percentage.

Short
-term interest rates are based on three
-month money market rates where available. Typical standardised names are "money market rate" and "treasury bill rate".

## get_ice_bofa_option_adjusted_spread
The ICE BofA Option
-Adjusted Spreads (OASs) are the calculated spreads between a computed OAS index of all bonds in a given maturity and rating category and a spot Treasury curve. An OAS index is constructed using each constituent bond's OAS, weighted by market capitalization.

The Option
-Adjusted Spread (OAS) is the spread relative to a risk
-free interest rate, usually measured in basis points (bp), that equates the theoretical present value of a series of uncertain cash flows to the market price of a fixed
-income investment. The spread is added to the risk
-free rate to compensate for the uncertainty of the cash flows.

## get_ice_bofa_effective_yield
This data represents the effective yield of the ICE BofA Indices, When the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.

The Effective Yield is the yield of a bond, calculated by dividing the bond's coupon payments by its market price. The effective yield is not the same as the stated yield, which is the yield on the bond's coupon payments divided by the bond's principal value. The effective yield is a more accurate measure of a bond's return, as it takes into account the fact that the investor will not hold the bond to maturity and will likely sell it before it matures.

## get_euribor_rates
Euribor rates, short for Euro Interbank Offered Rate, are the interest rates at which a panel of European banks lend funds to one another in the interbank market. These rates are published daily by the European Money Markets Institute (EMMI) and serve as a benchmark for various financial products and contracts, including mortgages, loans, and derivatives, across the Eurozone.

The Euribor rates are determined for different maturities, typically ranging from overnight to 12 months The most common maturities are 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. Each maturity represents the time period for which the funds are borrowed, with longer maturities generally implying higher interest rates due to increased uncertainty and risk over longer time horizons.

For more information, see for example: [https://data.ecb.europa.eu/data/datasets/FM/FM.M.U2.EUR.RT.MM.EURIBOR6MD_.HSTA](https://data.ecb.europa.eu/data/datasets/FM/FM.M.U2.EUR.RT.MM.EURIBOR6MD_.HSTA){:target="_blank"}

## get_european_central_bank_rates
The Governing Council of the ECB sets the key interest rates for the euro area. The available rates are:


- Main refinancing operations (refinancing) 
- Marginal lending facility (lending) 
- Deposit facility (deposit)

The main refinancing operations (MRO) rate is the interest rate banks pay when they borrow money from the ECB for one week. When they do this, they have to provide collateral to guarantee that the money will be paid back.

The marginal lending facility rate is the interest rate banks pay when they borrow from the ECB overnight. When they do this, they have to provide collateral, for example securities, to guarantee that the money will be paid back.

The deposit facility rate is one of the three interest rates the ECB sets every six weeks as part of its monetary policy. The rate defines the interest banks receive for depositing money with the central bank overnight.
