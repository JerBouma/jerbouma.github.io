I am strongly analytical, possess a keen sense of long-term investment strategy, and maintain a “can do” attitude. My achievements demonstrate this, including working as an ALM Advisor at PGGM, one of the largest Dutch pension funds, and as a Product Manager for OpenBB, a fintech start-up democratizing investment research access. Furthermore, I have a strong educational background in Finance, having completed CFA level 1 and the post-master Registered Financial Analyst (VBA/RBA) program. This education covers relevant theory and provides numerous examples of its application within various investment organizations.

Additionally, over the last several years, I have dedicated thousands of hours to developing Python skills, focusing on quantitative and statistical modeling, and data science. Explore my active open-source projects on the <a href="/projects">projects page</a>. These include the Finance Database and Financial Toolkit, each with well over 3,000 GitHub Stars, and the OpenBB Terminal, where I was a leading contributor, particularly in fundamental analysis, economics, fixed income, and econometrics.

This combination of skills culminates in my current role as Quantitative Investment Strategist at a.s.r. asset management, one of the largest insurance companies in the Netherlands. In this position, I spearhead innovative initiatives within the asset management divisions using Python, focusing on portfolio analytics and optimization. I also conduct Asset Liability Management (ALM) and Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA) analyses, covering topics such as hedging strategies, liquidity risk management, Solvency II optimization, and asset-only studies.

## Testimonials

**[Didier Lopes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/didier-lopes/) - CEO at OpenBB**

<div class="row">
<div markdown="1" class="eighty-column-left">
*On the 13th of October 2021, I received an email from Jeroen about adding one of his finance GitHub packages to the OpenBB Terminal (then Gamestonk Terminal). After digging into his open source projects and his achievements I was very impressed. When we had a chat regarding how to work together, I offered him a job on the spot. Jeroen was at the intersection of finance, programming and open source - which is a combination that is very hard to find - even today (almost 2 years later).*

*Jeroen ended up joining us a few months after that initial meeting. He started in the role of Product Manager where he helped drive the direction of the OpenBB Terminal, not only from a product perspective but also joining the development team. Menus such as economy, portfolio, econometrics, fixed income are Jeroen’s legacy and they wouldn’t have the quality they have today without Jeroen’s financial theory knowledge - ultimately, the team saw Jeroen as the go-to person when financial theory was involved.*

*More recently, Jeroen shifted to the role of Product Marketing Manager so that he could focus on the go-to market and showing users (through documentation, webinars, videos) how they could use OpenBB products for real use cases. In addition, he led OpenBB’s academia motion, and created presentations such as “The Greek Government Debt Crisis”, “Performing Financial Due Diligence” and “The Influence of the Central Bank” which used OpenBB for research and were presented at different universities in the UK and Netherlands.*

*Apart from his financial expertise, I always admired Jeroen’s work ethic and organization skills. As a startup founder, you want people on your team that get shit done, and Jeroen was one of those people. I never had to worry with a task not being done, or being done late. If anything, he always went above and beyond. I highly recommend Jeroen.*

**[Minh Hoang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/minhhoang95/) - Product Manager at OpenBB**

<div class="row">
<div markdown="1" class="eighty-column-left">
*I highly recommend Jeroen as an asset in any organization. Jeroen led and executed OpenBB's go-to-market initiatives, including Academia, with exceptional skill. It is not easy to find Jeroen's combination of solid finance knowledge and Programming knowledge. On top of that, he consistently demonstrates a strong work ethic and a drive to achieve outstanding results.*

**[Sri Chilukuri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/srichilukuri/) - Vice President of Product Marketing at OpenBB**

<div class="row">
<div markdown="1" class="eighty-column-left">
*Jeroen has been a delight to work with. With his expertise in investment research and “can do” attitude, he quickly transformed himself into an excellent product marketing manager at OpenBB. In fact, I would not hesitate to say that he was often the lone sane voice in helping steer the heavily engineering-centric company in the right business direction. His leadership of the highly successful OpenBB Terminal 2.0 launch event in November 2022 and the company's ongoing go-to-market (GTM) push into Academia are testaments to his newly acquired product marketing skills as well as his overall professionalism. Jeroen has my highest recommendation and I look forward to working with him again in the future.*

**[Luuk van Benthem](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luuk-van-benthem-b817a765/) - Senior ALM Adviseur at PGGM**

<div class="row">
<div markdown="1" class="eighty-column-left">
*Jeroen joined our team just at the right time. As we were considering a full redevelopment of our ALM model, Jeroen's knowledge of Python first greatly helped us in the decision process. In the implementation phase Jeroen played a key role on the development of the technical side of the model. Meanwhile he did a good job at educating our team on these new topics and providing good documentation. Working together with Jeroen was a pleasure. First of all he's a nice guy, Furthermore he provided an alternative way of thinking and working that was new for us and helped us innovate and work more efficiently. Over time I learned a lot from Jeroen which I'm very thankful for!*
