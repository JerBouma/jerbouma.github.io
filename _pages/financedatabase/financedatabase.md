As a private investor, the amount of information you can find on the internet is rather daunting. With millions of companies and derivatives on the market, it is hard to understand what types of companies or ETFs are available. The most traded companies and ETFs are easy to find because they are known to the public (for example, Microsoft, Tesla, S&P 500 ETF or an All-World ETF), but what else is out there is often unknown.

**This is why I created the Finance Database**, a database featuring 300,000+ symbols containing Equities, ETFs, Funds, Indices, Currencies, Cryptocurrencies and Money Markets. It allows you to obtain a broad overview of sectors, industries, types of investments and much more, entirely for free. Everything is stored in CSV files that anyone can read and edit, so the database grows and improves through the community.

The database is explicitly _not_ meant to provide up-to-date fundamentals or stock data, as those are easy to obtain (with the help of this database) through the [Finance Toolkit](/projects/financetoolkit). Instead, it shows which products exist in each country, industry and sector and gives the most essential information about each of them. With this information, you can analyze specific areas of the financial world or find a product that is otherwise hard to find. By using both, it is possible to do a fully-fledged competitive analysis with the tickers found in the Finance Database loaded into the Finance Toolkit.

## Installation

Before installation, consider starring the project on GitHub which helps others find the project as well.

<a href="https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase" target="_blank"><img width="1353" alt="image" src="https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase/assets/46355364/4132edde-72f9-4e32-adfe-8872207f46ff"></a>

Installing the Finance Database only requires the following (Python 3.11 or newer):

```bash
pip install financedatabase -U
```

Then within Python use:

```python
import financedatabase as fd

equities = fd.Equities()
```

No API key is needed. Each asset class is downloaded once and cached locally, see [Questions & Answers](#questions--answers) for how the cache works.

## Functionality
{: .heading-as-h1}
This section is an introduction to the Finance Database. The Getting Started Notebook contains many more examples, including the full output of each query.

[Find the Getting Started Notebook](/projects/financedatabase/getting-started){: .btn .btn--warning .btn--large .align-center}

A basic example of how to use the Finance Database is shown below. Every code snippet in the sections that follow builds on this same `equities` instance. Initialization of each asset class is only required <u>once</u>, so save it to a variable to query the database much more quickly.

```python
import financedatabase as fd

# Initialize the Equities database
equities = fd.Equities()

# Select all equities
equities.select()
```

A portion of the output is shown below. The tables in this section are cut off to five entries and a selection of the columns due to the sheer size of the database.

| symbol   | name                       | currency   | sector                 | industry                                   | exchange   | market               | country       | market_cap   | isin         |
|:---------|:---------------------------|:-----------|:-----------------------|:-------------------------------------------|:-----------|:---------------------|:--------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| AAPL     | Apple Inc.                 | USD        | Information Technology | Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals | NMS        | NASDAQ Global Select | United States | Mega Cap     | US0378331005 |
| ASML.AS  | ASML Holding N.V.          | EUR        | Information Technology | Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment   | AMS        | Euronext Amsterdam   | Netherlands   | Mega Cap     | NL0010273215 |
| 7203.T   | Toyota Motor Corporation   | JPY        | Consumer Discretionary | Automobiles                                | JPX        | Tokyo Stock Exchange | Japan         | Mega Cap     | JP3633400001 |
| NESN.SW  | Nestle S.A.                | CHF        | Consumer Staples       | Food Products                              | EBS        | SIX Swiss Exchange   | Switzerland   | Mega Cap     | CH0038863350 |
| SIE.DE   | Siemens Aktiengesellschaft | EUR        | Industrials            | Machinery                                  | GER        | XETRA                | Germany       | Mega Cap     | DE0007236101 |

And below the actively listed equities are counted per sector.

<div class="fd-chart">
  <img class="fd-chart--dark" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase/main/assets/readme/sectors-dark.png" alt="Actively listed equities per sector" loading="lazy">
  <img class="fd-chart--light" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase/main/assets/readme/sectors-light.png" alt="Actively listed equities per sector" loading="lazy">
</div>

Each asset class has the same three functions: `select` to filter on the database's categories, `search` to look for any text in any column and `show_options` to see which values a category can take. The asset classes are `fd.Equities()`, `fd.ETFs()`, `fd.Funds()`, `fd.Indices()`, `fd.Currencies()`, `fd.Cryptos()` and `fd.Moneymarkets()`.

Three capabilities cut across all of them:

- **Lists of values.** Every filter accepts a single value or a list, e.g. `country=['Netherlands', 'Belgium']`, returning the entries that match any of them.
- **`only_primary_listing` and `exclude_delisted`.** A company is often listed on many exchanges. `only_primary_listing=True` keeps only its primary listing, and delisted symbols are left out by default (`exclude_delisted=False` to include them).
- **pandas or Polars.** Queries run lazily with [Polars](https://pola.rs/){:target="_blank"} and return a pandas DataFrame by default, or a Polars DataFrame with `as_pandas=False`.

### Exploring the Options

With `show_options`, all possible options are given per column. **This is useful as it doesn't require loading the larger data files.**

```python
# Show the options of every column of the equities
options = fd.show_options("equities")

# Select the sectors
options["sector"]
```

This returns the eleven sectors used for equities, which approximate GICS:

```text
['Communication Services', 'Consumer Discretionary', 'Consumer Staples',
 'Energy', 'Financials', 'Health Care', 'Industrials',
 'Information Technology', 'Materials', 'Real Estate', 'Utilities']
```

Once an asset class is loaded, `show_options` is also available on the class itself, where it shows the options that remain after filtering. For example, the industries of the financial companies in the Netherlands:

```python
# Show the industries of financial companies in the Netherlands
equities.show_options(
    selection="industry",
    sector="Financials",
    country="Netherlands",
)
```

Which returns:

```text
['Banks', 'Capital Markets', 'Consumer Finance',
 'Diversified Financial Services', 'Insurance']
```

And below the number of companies in each of these industries is shown. Each company is counted once, however many exchanges it is listed on: listings that share an ISIN, share class FIGI, website or the first word of their name (such as Aegon and its perpetual bonds) are combined.

<div class="fd-chart">
  <img class="fd-chart--dark" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase/main/assets/readme/options-dark.png" alt="Dutch financial companies per industry" loading="lazy">
  <img class="fd-chart--light" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase/main/assets/readme/options-light.png" alt="Dutch financial companies per industry" loading="lazy">
</div>

The options of every column can be shown this way, including `currency`, `exchange`, `market`, `country` and `market_cap` (Mega, Large, Mid, Small, Micro and Nano Cap). **Find the Notebook [here](/projects/financedatabase/getting-started).**

### Selecting Equities

Given these options, it becomes possible to filter the database on the categories you are interested in. For example, the 'Insurance' companies in the 'United States', one row per company. The `sector` can be omitted here since the industry already implies 'Financials'.

```python
# Select the primary listings of insurance companies in the United States
equities.select(
    country="United States",
    industry="Insurance",
    only_primary_listing=True,
)
```

This returns about 180 companies, of which a few of the larger ones are shown below.

| symbol   | name                             | currency   | sector     | industry   | exchange   | market                  | country       | market_cap   |
|:---------|:---------------------------------|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|:------------------------|:--------------|:-------------|
| AFL      | Aflac Incorporated               | USD        | Financials | Insurance  | NYQ        | New York Stock Exchange | United States | Large Cap    |
| AJG      | Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.        | USD        | Financials | Insurance  | NYQ        | New York Stock Exchange | United States | Large Cap    |
| BRO      | Brown & Brown, Inc.              | USD        | Financials | Insurance  | NYQ        | New York Stock Exchange | United States | Large Cap    |
| CINF     | Cincinnati Financial Corporation | USD        | Financials | Insurance  | NMS        | NASDAQ Global Select    | United States | Large Cap    |
| PGR      | Progressive Corporation          | USD        | Financials | Insurance  | NYQ        | New York Stock Exchange | United States | Large Cap    |

Without `only_primary_listing=True`, the same query returns about 450 listings on more than 20 exchanges, because every exchange a company trades on is shown by default. Progressive, for example, also appears as `PGV.F` (Frankfurt), `PGV.SG` (Stuttgart), `PGR.MX` (Mexico) and `P1GR34.SA` (B3). Primary listings are the symbols without an exchange suffix, which makes the option mostly useful for US companies. For companies elsewhere, filter on the `exchange` or `market` instead.

For the Netherlands, it makes sense to select the market "Euronext Amsterdam" (exchange "AMS"), here together with the market cap:

```python
# Select the large insurance companies on Euronext Amsterdam
equities.select(
    country="Netherlands",
    industry="Insurance",
    market="Euronext Amsterdam",
    market_cap="Large Cap",
)
```

This gives the following three companies:

| symbol   | name               | currency   | sector     | industry   | exchange   | market             | country     | market_cap   | isin         |
|:---------|:-------------------|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|:-------------------|:------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| AGN.AS   | Aegon N.V.         | EUR        | Financials | Insurance  | AMS        | Euronext Amsterdam | Netherlands | Large Cap    | BMG0112X1056 |
| ASRNL.AS | ASR Nederland N.V. | EUR        | Financials | Insurance  | AMS        | Euronext Amsterdam | Netherlands | Large Cap    | NL0011872643 |
| NN.AS    | NN Group N.V.      | EUR        | Financials | Insurance  | AMS        | Euronext Amsterdam | Netherlands | Large Cap    | NL0010773842 |

Every filter also accepts a list, so both queries can be combined into one with `country=["Netherlands", "United States"]` and `market=["Euronext Amsterdam", "New York Stock Exchange", "NASDAQ Global Select"]`. Equities can be selected on `country`, `sector`, `industry_group`, `industry`, `currency`, `exchange`, `mic`, `market` and `market_cap`. **Find the Notebook [here](/projects/financedatabase/getting-started).**

### Searching the Database

If the categorization doesn't lead to the results you are looking for, `search` filters on any column via a custom string. If the text is found anywhere in the column, the entry is returned. Searches are not case sensitive unless `case_sensitive=True` is set, `index` searches the symbol and, just like `select`, every argument accepts a list.

```python
# Search for robotics or education companies with equipment on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange
equities.search(
    summary=["Robotics", "Education"],
    industry_group="Equipment",
    market="Frankfurt",
    index=".F",
)
```

This returns about 60 instruments listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, in an industry group containing "Equipment" and with "Robotics" or "Education" in their summary. Filtering on `index=".F"` is an alternative way to find the exchange or market you are looking for.

| symbol   | name                                                        | currency   | sector                 | industry                                       | exchange   | market                   | country        | market_cap   |
|:---------|:------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------|:-----------------------|:-----------------------------------------------|:-----------|:-------------------------|:---------------|:-------------|
| 089.F    | Cambium Networks Corporation                                | EUR        | Information Technology | Communications Equipment                       | FRA        | Frankfurt Stock Exchange | Cayman Islands | Micro Cap    |
| 109.F    | Castlight Health, Inc.                                      | EUR        | Health Care            | Health Care Technology                         | FRA        | Frankfurt Stock Exchange | United States  | Small Cap    |
| 1KT.F    | Keysight Technologies Inc                                   | EUR        | Information Technology | Electronic Equipment, Instruments & Components | FRA        | Frankfurt Stock Exchange | United States  | Large Cap    |
| 1N1.F    | Nanalysis Scientific Corp.                                  | EUR        | Information Technology | Electronic Equipment, Instruments & Components | FRA        | Frankfurt Stock Exchange | Canada         | Nano Cap     |
| 1YO.F    | Yangtze Optical Fibre And Cable Joint Stock Limited Company | EUR        | Information Technology | Communications Equipment                       | FRA        | Frankfurt Stock Exchange | China          | Large Cap    |

And below the results are counted per industry.

<div class="fd-chart">
  <img class="fd-chart--dark" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase/main/assets/readme/search-dark.png" alt="Search results per industry" loading="lazy">
  <img class="fd-chart--light" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase/main/assets/readme/search-light.png" alt="Search results per industry" loading="lazy">
</div>

The `search` function works on every column of every asset class, including `name`, `isin`, `cusip` and `figi`. For example, `equities.search(isin="US0378331005")` returns Apple on each exchange it is listed on. **Find the Notebook [here](/projects/financedatabase/getting-started).**

### Exploring Other Asset Classes

All of these functions are also available for the other asset classes. The only difference is the class name and the columns. For example, ETFs use `fd.ETFs()` and are selected on `category_group`, `category` and `family` instead.

```python
# Initialize the ETFs database
etfs = fd.ETFs()

# Select the Fixed Income ETFs of Vanguard
etfs.select(
    category_group="Fixed Income",
    family="Vanguard Asset Management",
)
```

For example, see some of the Vanguard bond ETFs listed in Berlin below:

| symbol   | name                                                            | currency   | category_group   | category               | family                    | exchange   |
|:---------|:----------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------|:-----------------|:-----------------------|:--------------------------|:-----------|
| 0250.BE  | Vanguard Intermediate-Term Corporate Bond Index Fund ETF Shares | EUR        | Fixed Income     | Corporate Bonds        | Vanguard Asset Management | BER        |
| 0251.BE  | Vanguard Short-Term Corporate Bond Index Fund ETF Shares        | EUR        | Fixed Income     | Corporate Bonds        | Vanguard Asset Management | BER        |
| 0252.BE  | Vanguard Total World Bond ETF                                   | EUR        | Fixed Income     | Investment Grade Bonds | Vanguard Asset Management | BER        |
| 025L.BE  | Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund ETF Shares         | EUR        | Fixed Income     | Investment Grade Bonds | Vanguard Asset Management | BER        |
| 025N.BE  | Vanguard Long-Term Corporate Bond Index Fund ETF Shares         | EUR        | Fixed Income     | Corporate Bonds        | Vanguard Asset Management | BER        |

The same applies to `search`, for example to find the funds that focus on pension plans:

```python
# Initialize the Funds database
funds = fd.Funds()

# Search for funds with "Pension" in their summary
funds.search(summary="Pension")
```

Which returns over 600 funds, of which a few are shown below:

| symbol       | name                                | currency   | category_group   | category                 | family                           | exchange   |
|:-------------|:------------------------------------|:-----------|:-----------------|:-------------------------|:---------------------------------|:-----------|
| 0P000015HA.F | Casermed Protección 6 PP            | EUR        | Equities         | Allocation               | Sa Nostra Seguros de Vida SA     | FRA        |
| 0P000015V5.F | BK Revalorización Europa 2022 PP    | EUR        | Fixed Income     | Bonds                    | Bankinter                        | FRA        |
| 0P000015VC.F | Bankia Protegido Renta 2023 PP      | EUR        | Fixed Income     | Bonds                    | Bankia Fondos                    | FRA        |
| 0P000017AE.F | Santander Universidades RF Mixta PP | EUR        | Fixed Income     | Bonds                    | Santander Asset Management SGIIC | FRA        |
| 0P000017AF.F | OpenBank Monetario PP               | EUR        | Cash             | Money Market Instruments | Santander Asset Management SGIIC | FRA        |

And below all actively listed ETFs are divided over their category groups.

<div class="fd-chart">
  <img class="fd-chart--dark" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase/main/assets/readme/etfs-dark.png" alt="Actively listed ETFs per category group" loading="lazy">
  <img class="fd-chart--light" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase/main/assets/readme/etfs-light.png" alt="Actively listed ETFs per category group" loading="lazy">
</div>

The categories of each asset class can again be found with `show_options`, e.g. `fd.Indices().show_options(selection="category")` returns the 42 index categories, from 'Corporate Bonds' and 'Emerging Markets' to 'Small Cap' and 'Value'. Cryptocurrencies are selected on `cryptocurrency` and `currency`, currencies on `base_currency` and `quote_currency` and money markets on `currency` and `family`. **Find the Notebook [here](/projects/financedatabase/getting-started).**

### Combining with the Finance Toolkit

The Finance Database has a direct integration with the [Finance Toolkit](/projects/financetoolkit), making it possible to do financial analysis on the instruments you've found. Any selection can be loaded into the Finance Toolkit with `to_toolkit`.

To be able to get started, you need to obtain an API Key from FinancialModelingPrep. This gives access to 30+ years of financial statements, both annual and quarterly. Note that the Free plan is limited to 250 requests each day, 5 years of data and only features companies listed on US exchanges.

[Obtain an API Key from FinancialModelingPrep](/fmp){: .btn .btn--warning .btn--large .align-center target="_blank"}

Returning to the three large insurance companies in the Netherlands:

```python
# Select the large insurance companies on Euronext Amsterdam
dutch_insurance_companies = equities.select(
    country="Netherlands",
    industry="Insurance",
    market="Euronext Amsterdam",
    market_cap="Large Cap",
)

# Load them into the Finance Toolkit
toolkit = dutch_insurance_companies.to_toolkit(api_key="FINANCIAL_MODELING_PREP_KEY")

# Obtain historical market data for all tickers
historical_data = toolkit.get_historical_data()

# Select the results for ASR Nederland
historical_data.xs("ASRNL.AS", axis=1, level=1)
```

For example, a portion of the historical data for ASR Nederland is shown below.

| date       |   Open |   High |   Low |   Close |   Adj Close |   Volume |   Dividends |   Return |   Cumulative Return |

Now let's make it more advanced by calculating the profitability ratios for each company:

```python
# Collect all Profitability Ratios for all tickers
profitability_ratios = toolkit.ratios.collect_profitability_ratios()

# Select the results for ASR Nederland
profitability_ratios.loc["ASRNL.AS"]
```

For example, see some of the profitability ratios of ASR Nederland below.

|:--------------------------------|-------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|--------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|
| Net Profit Margin               | 0.1055 | 0.116  | 0.0811 | 0.091  |  0.1666 | 0.0814 | 0.0427 | 0.024  |
| Income Before Tax Profit Margin | 0.1564 | 0.1515 | 0.1104 | 0.1231 |  0.2202 | 0.1089 | 0.0688 | 0.0328 |

And below these and other profitability ratios of ASR Nederland, each with its latest value, the change over the period and its trend.

This works for the other asset classes too. For example, Ethereum quoted in BTC, CAD, EUR, GBP and USD can be loaded with `fd.Cryptos().select(cryptocurrency="ETH").to_toolkit(api_key="FINANCIAL_MODELING_PREP_KEY")`, after which `get_historical_data(period="quarterly")` returns its quarterly returns in each currency. **This is just a small snippet of what is available within the Finance Toolkit. For more information, see the Finance Toolkit page [here](/projects/financetoolkit) or the example Notebook [here](/projects/financetoolkit/getting-started).**

## MCP Server
{: .heading-as-h1}
The Finance Database MCP Server gives any AI assistant that supports the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io){:target="_blank"} (MCP), such as Claude, Copilot, Cursor or Windsurf, direct access to the database. Ask in plain English for, say, every mid cap semiconductor company in Taiwan or the bond ETFs of a given issuer, and the assistant queries the database on your behalf. No API key is needed.

Connect to the hosted server at `https://financedatabase.jeroenbouma.com/mcp` with nothing to install, or run it locally with `uvx --from "financedatabase[mcp]" financedatabase-mcp-setup`, which adds the server to your client's configuration automatically. Combine it with the [Finance Toolkit MCP Server](/projects/financetoolkit/mcp) to go from a list of symbols to their financial statements, ratios and prices.

## Questions & Answers
{: .heading-as-h1}
This section includes frequently asked questions. If you have any questions that are not answered here, consider creating an [Issue](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase/issues){:target="_blank"} or reach out to me via the contact details below.

> **How is the data obtained?**

The data is an aggregation of various publicly available sources. I strictly maintain the rule that all data in this database must be freely accessible to everyone. Data requiring API keys or paid subscriptions is never included. Information that companies charge for is typically owned and maintained by those companies, making public sharing of such data a violation of their Terms of Service (ToS). However, publicly available data can be freely shared (read more about the legality of web scraping [here](https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/18/web-scraping-legal-court/){:target="_blank"}). This database will always remain <u>completely free</u>.

> **What categorization method is used?**

The categorization for Equities is based on a loose approximation of GICS (Global Industry Classification Standard). This database attempts to reflect sectors and industries as accurately as possible through manual curation, without collecting any actual data from MSCI's proprietary sources. The official GICS datasets curated by MSCI remain the most up-to-date, paid solution and were not used in developing any part of this database. All other categorizations in the database are independently developed and can be freely modified.

> **How can I find out which countries, sectors and/or industries exist within the database without needing to check the database manually?**

For this you can use the `show_options` function, either for an asset class as a whole (`fd.show_options("equities")`), which doesn't require any data to be loaded, or on a loaded asset class to see the options that remain after filtering. See [Exploring the Options](#exploring-the-options) for more information.

> **When I try to collect data I notice that not all tickers return output, why is that?**

Some tickers are merely holdings of companies and therefore do not really have any data attached to them. Therefore, it makes sense that not all tickers return data. If you are still in doubt, search the ticker on Google to see if there is really no data available. If you can't find anything about the ticker, consider updating the database by visiting the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md){:target="_blank"}.

> **How does the database handle changes to companies over time, like symbol/exchange migration, mergers, bankruptcies, or symbols getting reused?**

For American exchanges, the database automatically updates every Sunday using data from [this repository](https://github.com/rreichel3/US-Stock-Symbols){:target="_blank"}. This process includes checks for market cap changes and updates asset classifications accordingly. Delisted tickers are intentionally retained for historical research purposes.

While professional financial data services like Bloomberg charge over $25,000 annually for comprehensive market data maintenance, this database relies on community contributions. When companies outside American exchanges undergo changes (migrations, mergers, bankruptcies), we depend on community members to identify and update these entries.

Most companies don't change so rapidly that the database becomes obsolete. Major changes like Facebook's rebrand to META are quickly incorporated. Even when companies go bankrupt, their ticker information remains valuable for historical analysis.

If you notice outdated information, please consider contributing through the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md){:target="_blank"}.

> **Is the data downloaded every time I use the package?**

No. Each dataset is downloaded once and cached in your user cache folder (or the folder set in `FINANCEDATABASE_CACHE_DIR`). Once a day the package checks for a newer version and only downloads it when it changed; offline, the cached copy is used. Queries run lazily with [Polars](https://pola.rs/){:target="_blank"} and return pandas by default, or Polars with `as_pandas=False`, e.g. `equities.select(country="Canada", as_pandas=False)`.

## Contributing
{: .heading-as-h1}
First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute (or at least read the Contributing Guidelines)!

[Find the Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md){: .btn .btn--warning .btn--large .align-center target="_blank"}

The Finance Database serves the role of providing anyone with any type of financial product categorization entirely for free. To achieve this, it relies on community involvement to add, edit and remove tickers over time. This is made easy enough that anyone, even those with a lack of coding experience, can contribute because of the use of CSV files that can be manually edited with ease.

Below are those that made significant contributions to the project. Thank you!
