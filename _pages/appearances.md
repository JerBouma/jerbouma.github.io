On this page, you will find a collection of my experiences and contributions within the finance and technology sectors. I had the privilege of serving as a jury member in the Utrecht University's Finance Hackathon, where students were challenged to create a Robo Advisor using Python. Additionally, I delivered presentations at universities, introducing the OpenBB Terminal and highlighting the role of Python in the financial industry. These experiences reflect my commitment to sharing knowledge and insights within the finance and technology domains, making this page a valuable resource for those interested in these fields. **Interested in partnering with me?

## Speaker at the Student Capital Society Rotterdam

<div class="row">
<div markdown="1" class="fifty-column-left mobile-max-column-width">

Being a relatively new society, the Student Capital Society Rotterdam hosted their first event, which I had the pleasure of attending. The event was a great success, with over 100 students in attendance. I was invited to give a presentation about role in the financial sector and how I perceive the role of Python within the industry.

It was a great opportunity to share my experiences and discuss with the students the way institutional investors bring financial theory into practice.

The other speaker, Vladimir Mikirtumov, discussed the role Cryptocurrencies can have in the financial sector specifically focussed on institutional investors. A compelling story that left plenty of room for discussion.

## Guiding Students in the Utrecht University's Hackathon

<div class="row">
<div markdown="1" class="fifty-column-left mobile-max-column-width">

I had the privilege of serving as a jury member for a Hackathon for Finance students. Their objective was to develop a Robo Advisor using Python, utilising a dataset comprising of nearly 2,500 ETFs.

What made this challenge very interesting was the need for students to find a balance between using Python for quantitative portfolio construction tailored to the given investor profile, and ensuring that the optimised portfolio made practical sense. My role was to guide the students in combining their knowledge of financial theory with their Python skills to provide sound investment advice.

I strongly believe in that the importance of Python in the financial industry will continue to grow and that is why I keep coming back each year.

## Revolutionizing The Way Investment Research Is Done

<div class="row">
<div markdown="1" class="fifty-column-left mobile-max-column-width">
I gave two presentations at the University of Loughborough and for the University of Warwick. It was very rewarding to see the amount of interest from students as both sessions had well over 100 students present.

These presentations were meant to enlighten students about the OpenBB Terminal and what OpenBB wants to achieve in the near future. This recording was done at the University of Warwick in collaboration with the Warwick Finance Society.

## Role of Python in the Financial Industry 

<div class="row">
<div markdown="1" class="fifty-column-left mobile-max-column-width">
I got approached by Utrecht University whether I'd be interested in providing a guest lecture to Finance students taking a workshop on Python. Being an alumni myself and enthusiastic about Python, I couldn't let this opportunity pass to return back to my former University.

Therefore, I did four presentations for nearly a hundred Master students at the campus. My goal with these presentations was to enlighten the students to take Python seriously for their careers within the financial sector, explaining the practical application with personal experience.

<div markdown="1" class="fifty-column-left mobile-max-column-width">
Within this webinar I explored how to do financial due diligence with the OpenBB Terminal which requires an examination of financial records before entering into a proposed transaction with another party.

Within this webinar I explored the main revenue streams, historical stock prices, dividends and stock splits, understand management, ownership and market capitalization, revenue and profit margins and future expectations.

## Introduction to the OpenBB Terminal

<div class="row">
<div markdown="1" class="fifty-column-left mobile-max-column-width">
As part of my initative to present OpenBB to students and professors, I've been introducing the OpenBB Terminal to the students at Athens University in which I go over the structure, the basics and two use-cases.

The goal was to give a clear overview of some of the capabilities of the OpenBB Terminal and explain to the students how they can use the OpenBB Terminal for their market and investment reports.
