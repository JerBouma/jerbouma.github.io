On this page, you will find a collection of my experiences and contributions within the finance and technology sectors. I had the privilege of serving as a jury member for the Utrecht University Finance Hackathon, where students were challenged to create a Robo Advisor using Python. Additionally, I delivered presentations at universities, introducing the OpenBB Terminal and highlighting the role of Python in the financial industry. These experiences reflect my commitment to sharing knowledge and insights within the finance and technology domains, making this page a valuable resource for those interested in these fields. **Interested in partnering with me?

## Speaker at the Student Capital Society Rotterdam

<div class="row">
<div markdown="1" class="fifty-column-left mobile-max-column-width">

As a relatively new society, the Student Capital Society Rotterdam hosted its first event, which I had the pleasure of attending. The event was a great success, with over 100 students in attendance. I was invited to give a presentation about my role in the financial sector and how I perceive the role of Python within the industry.

It was a great opportunity to share my experiences and discuss with the students how institutional investors bring financial theory into practice.

The other speaker, Vladimir Mikirtumov, discussed the potential role of Cryptocurrencies in the financial sector, specifically focusing on institutional investors. It was a compelling story that left plenty of room for discussion.

## Guiding Students in the Utrecht University Hackathon

<div class="row">
<div markdown="1" class="fifty-column-left mobile-max-column-width">

I had the privilege of serving as a jury member for a Hackathon aimed at Finance students. Their objective was to develop a Robo Advisor using Python, utilizing a dataset comprising nearly 2,500 ETFs.

What made this challenge particularly interesting was the need for students to balance using Python for quantitative portfolio construction tailored to a given investor profile, while ensuring the optimized portfolio made practical sense. My role was to guide the students in combining their knowledge of financial theory with their Python skills to provide sound investment advice.

I strongly believe the importance of Python in the financial industry will continue to grow, which is why I keep coming back each year.

I gave presentations at the University of Loughborough and the University of Warwick. It was very rewarding to see the high level of interest from students, as both sessions had well over 100 attendees.

These presentations aimed to inform students about the OpenBB Terminal and OpenBB's future goals. This recording was made at the University of Warwick in collaboration with the Warwick Finance Society.

## Role of Python in the Financial Industry

<div class="row">
<div markdown="1" class="fifty-column-left mobile-max-column-width">
I was approached by Utrecht University about providing a guest lecture to Finance students taking a Python workshop. As an alumnus myself and enthusiastic about Python, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to return to my alma mater.

Therefore, I gave four presentations to nearly one hundred Master's students on campus. My goal was to encourage students to take Python seriously for their careers in the financial sector, explaining its practical applications based on my personal experience.

As part of my initiative to present OpenBB to students and professors, I introduced the OpenBB Terminal to students at Athens University, covering its structure, basics, and two use cases.

The goal was to provide a clear overview of the OpenBB Terminal's capabilities and explain how students can use it for their market and investment reports.
