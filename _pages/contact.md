I am always excited to engage in conversations about financial theory, explore new Python-based financial projects, or delve into general discussions about finance. If you share a passion for these topics and would like to support my work, I would be grateful if you considered [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/JerBouma). Your sponsorship helps fuel these endeavors, and constructive feedback is always equally appreciated!

Feel free to reach out to me for:

1.  Questions regarding any of my open-source projects, such as the Finance Toolkit or the Finance Database.
2.  Requests to collaborate on a project, event, or other initiatives.
3.  General discussions about the financial industry or Python programming.
